I hold a Ph.D. (2011) in Information, Communication and Audiovisual Media Technologies from the Universitat Pompeu Fabra (UPF). I have been a research fellow in the Hamilton Institute of the National University of Ireland, Maynooth (2012-2014), in Trinity College Dublin (2015-2016) and in Inria- Lille in France (first half of 2016). Currently, I am an associate professor at the WINE research group of the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). In August 2016, I featured the list "10 Women in Networking/Communications That You Should Watch" of the N2Women organisation. My research interests include coexistence of wireless heterogeneous networks and distributed resource allocation.
